# Meter Event Summary

A billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.

Note: Meters events are aggregated asynchronously so the meter event summaries provide an eventually consistent view of the reported usage.
